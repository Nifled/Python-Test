# Python-Test
Testing out Git - Python using ST3

Lets see if I can put my Git skills to the test.

I'm currently watching a Google mini-course on Python which is on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKTZoB2Vjuk) as I read 'Learn Python the Hard Way'. All I want is to get better and a bit more familiar with the Pythonic ways. Any excersises or code relevant to this course will be pushed in this particular repo. Also, as mentioned above, practicing Git!
